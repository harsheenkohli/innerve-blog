# Innerve BLOG page submission by Harsheen Kaur Kohli
[.] I have used Bootstrap as I like working with it and due to the deadline (laptop   
    was under repair)
[.] Took inspiration from NPM site and made "Innerve" in navbar a little interesting
[.] Was thinking of making a page after clicking on "View" but I have a Data Structures class
    assignment due which I have been pushing forth to design the page, as well as have been fighting for a place in hostel (will try to make further commits when possible).
[.] Planning to continue WebDev and bag some internship at the end of soph year, kindly consider, I 
    would love a learning environment.

> Thank you!
> PS. I don't really know and am unable to understand how to make one with correct format :(
  WOuld love to learn this too (if possible)
